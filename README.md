# HILSIM_v2
The goal of the task is to further develop an already existing test environment in terms of software, within a Python environment. A prerequisite for completing the task is to become familiar with the operating principle of the existing test panel, which is based on Arduino.

The test environment, which primarily serves educational purposes, provides an opportunity to quickly learn and understand the HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) testing procedures used in the thyssenkrupp competence center.

Within the framework of this thesis, the software simulation of the test environment will be developed. This will make it possible to acquire knowledge and gain experience even when the physical test panel is not available (e.g., in remote learning).

The task also includes studying the theoretical background of software testing, learning about the corporate test environment (especially the SW-HIL environment), and implementing a Python-based simulation that integrates into the existing framework environment.
